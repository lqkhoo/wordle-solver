# Wordle solver
Simple implementation of a solver for Wordle, using the original wordlist.

This is not meant to be interactive. It just generates a solution tree by repeatedly partitioning the solution space. There's also a notebook that implements minimum solutions for Mastermind.

This project was used to explore the `cupy` library and Nvidia's new profiling tools over the course of a week, so don't expect too much from it =)
